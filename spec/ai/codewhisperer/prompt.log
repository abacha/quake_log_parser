  Build a spec file for this game.rb

>>
  Sure, here's an example of a spec file for the provided game.rb

    class: <game_spec.rb>

  This spec file covers the main functionality of the Game class, including initialization, player management, kill tracking, scoring, and kill statistics. Each test case checks a specific behavior of the class, ensuring that the implementation meets the expected requirements.

  You can run these tests using a testing framework like RSpec. To do so, you'll need to have RSpec installed and configured in your project. Then, you can run the tests with the following command:
  rspec spec/game_spec.rb

  This will execute the tests and report the results, helping you ensure that the Game class is working as expected.

  Build aspec file for game_manager.rb

>>
  Sure, here's an example of a spec file for the GameManager

    class: <game_manager_spec.rb>

  This spec file covers the main functionality of the GameManager
  class, including initialization, parsing the log file, handling different types of log lines, and managing the game and report data.

  The tests cover the public methods of the class, as well as the private helper methods that handle the different types of log lines. Each test case checks a specific behavior of the class, ensuring that the implementation meets the expected requirements.

  You can run these tests using a testing framework like RSpec. To do so, you'll need to have RSpec installed and configured in your project. Then, you can run the tests with the following command:
  rspec spec/game_manager_spec.rb

  This will execute the tests and report the results, helping you ensure that the GameManager class is working as expected.

  I have 3 log examples (game2.log, game5.log, game7.log)
  Create an integration test with 3 scenarios that parses the log file and validates the whole application

>>
  Sure, here's an example of an integration test that covers the parsing of the three log files and validates the overall application:

  class: <integration_spec.rb>

  This integration test covers the following scenarios:

  - Parsing the game2.log file and validating the game report.
  - Parsing the game5.log file and validating the game report.
  - Parsing the game7.log file and validating the game report.

  The test uses a hash log_files to store the expected results for each log file. The test then iterates over the log files, creates a GameManager instance for each file, calls the parse
   method, and validates the resulting game report against the expected values.

  To run this integration test, you'll need to have the
  game2.log, game5.log, and game7.log files in the spec/fixtures directory. You can then run the test with the following command:

  rspec spec/integration/game_manager_integration_spec.rb

  This will execute the integration test and report the results, ensuring that the
  GameManager class is able to correctly parse the log files and generate the expected game reports.
